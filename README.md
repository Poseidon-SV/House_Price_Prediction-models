## Models Used

### Linear Regression :
> Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output).

### Polynomial Regression :
> polynomial regression is a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y) is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x (input).

### Random Forest Regression :
>  A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

### Support Vector Regression :
>   Support Vector Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to predict discrete values. Support Vector Regression uses the same principle as the SVMs. The basic idea behind SVR is to find the best fit line. In SVR, the best fit line is the hyperplane that has the maximum number of points.
